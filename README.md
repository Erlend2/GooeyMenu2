Hello,

This is an updated edition of the GooeyMenu library created by anshulagarwal06. 
As of 11th May 2020, he hasn't made any changes to it since Dec 26, 2016 (link: https://github.com/anshulagarwal06/GooeyMenu). 
I thought his menu has even more potential, and therefore I wanted to continue his work here.
This is my first library, so please have patience with me.

To use the library:

Step 1 - Add jitpack to the project build.gradle:

    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }

Step 2 - Add it as an dependency in your app build.gradle:

    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.Erlend2:gooeymenu2:1.0.0'
    }

More directions on how to use coming very soon!
